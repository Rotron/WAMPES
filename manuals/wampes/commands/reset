.H 2 "reset" " [\fIsession#\fP]"
Reset the specified session, if no argument is given, reset the current
session. This command should be used with caution since it does not
reliably inform the remote end that the connection no longer exists. In
TCP a reset (RST) message will be automatically generated should the remote
TCP send anything after a local \fBreset\fP has been done. In AX.25 the DM
message performs a similar role. Both are used to get rid of a lingering
half-open connection after a remote system has crashed.
