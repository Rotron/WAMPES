.H 2 "memory" " \fIsubcommand\fP"
These commands control memory allocation.
.H 3 "memory debug" " [on|off]"
The default is \fBoff\fP.
MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "memory freelist"
Display the storage allocator free list. MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "memory merge" " [on|off]"
The default is \fBoff\fP.
TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "memory sizes"
Display a histogram of storage allocator request sizes. Each histogram
bin is a binary order of magnitude (i.e., a factor of 2).
.H 3 "memory status"
Display a summary of storage allocator statistics. The first line
shows the total size of the heap, the amount of heap
memory available in bytes and as a percentage of the total heap size,
and the number of sbrk() system calls used to increase the heap size.
.P
The second line shows the total number of calls to allocate and free blocks
of memory, the difference of these two values (i.e., the number of allocated
blocks outstanding), the number of allocation requests that were denied
due to lack of memory, and the number of calls to free() that attempted to
free garbage
(eg. by freeing the same block twice or freeing a garbled pointer).
.P
The third line shows the total number of splits
(breaking a big heap block into two small blocks)
and merges
(combining two adjacent small blocks into one big block),
and the difference of these two values.
.P
The fourth line shows the number of calls to pushdown, and the number of calls to pushdown which resulted in a call to malloc.
