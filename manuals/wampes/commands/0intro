.H 1 "Commands"
This section describes the commands recognized in command mode, or
within a startup file such as \fBnet.rc\fP. These are given in the following
notation:
.DS
\fBcommand\fP
\fBcommand\fP \fIparameter\fP
\fBcommand subcommand\fP \fIparameter\fP
\fBcommand\fP [\fIoptional_parameter\fP]
\fBcommand a|b\fP
.DE
Many commands take subcommands or parameters, which may be optional or
required. In general, if a required subcommand or parameter is omitted,
an error message will summarize the available subcommands or required
parameters. Giving a \fB?\fP in place of the subcommand will also
generate the message. This is useful when the command word alone is a
valid command. If a command takes an optional value parameter, issuing
the command without the parameter generally displays the current value
of the variable. Exceptions to this rule are noted in the individual
command descriptions.
.P
Two or more parameters separated by vertical bar(s) denote a choice
between the specified values. Optional parameters are shown enclosed in
[brackets], and a parameter shown as \fIparameter\fP should be
replaced with an actual value or string. For example, the notation
\fIhostid\fP denotes an actual host or gateway, which may be specified in
one of two ways: as a numeric IP address in dotted decimal notation
(eg. 44.0.0.1), or as a symbolic name stored in the domain name database.
.P
All commands and many subcommands may be abbreviated. You only need
type enough of a command's name to distinguish it from others that begin
with the same series of letters. Parameters, however, must be typed in
full.
.P
FTP subcommands (eg. put, get, dir, etc) are recognized only in
converse mode with the appropriate FTP session, they are not recognized
in command mode (see the \fBFTP Subcommands\fP chapter).
.P
A word beginning with \fB#\fP causes that word and all the following
characters on the same line to be ignored.
