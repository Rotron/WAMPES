.H 2 "ax25" " \fIsubcommand\fP"
These commands control the AX.25 service.
.H 3 "ax25 blimit" " [\fIlimit\fP]"
Display or set the AX.25 retransmission backoff limit. Normally each
successive AX.25 retransmission is delayed by a factor of 1.25 compared to
the previous interval, this is called \fBexponential backoff\fP.
When the number of retries reaches the \fBblimit\fP setting the backoff
is held at its current value, and is not increased anymore.
Note that this is applicable only to actual AX.25 connections, UI frames
will never be retransmitted by the AX.25 layer.
The default is 16.
.H 3 "ax25 destlist" " [\fIinterface\fP]"
Display the AX.25 "destination" list.
Each address seen in the destination field
of an AX.25 frame is displayed (most recent first),
along with the time since it was last referenced.
The time since the same address was last seen in the source field
of an AX.25 frame on the same interface is also shown.
If the address has never been seen in the source field of a frame,
then this field is left blank.
(This indicates that the destination is either a multicast address or a "hidden station".)
If \fIinterface\fP is given, only the list for that interface is displayed.
.H 3 "ax25 digipeat" " [0|1|2]"
Display or set the digipeat mode. The default is 2. MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "ax25 flush"
Clear the AX.25 "heard" and "destination" lists
(see \fBax25 heard\fP and \fBax25 destlist\fP).
.H 3 "ax25 heard" " [\fIinterface\fP]"
Display the AX.25 "heard" list.
For each interface that is configured to use AX.25,
a list of all addresses heard through that interface is shown,
along with a count of the number of packets heard from each station
and the interval, in days:hr:min:sec format, since each station was last heard.
The list is sorted in most-recently-heard order.
The local station appears first in the listing,
the packet count actually reflects the number of packets transmitted.
This count will be correct whether or not the modem monitors
its own transmissions.
If \fIinterface\fP is given, only the list for that interface is displayed.
.H 3 "ax25 jumpstart" " \fIax25_addr\fP [on|off]"
The default is \fBoff\fP.
MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "ax25 kick" " \fIaxcb_addr\fP"
If there is unacknowledged data on the send queue of the specified AX.25
control block, this command forces an immediate retransmission.
The control block address can be found with the \fBax25 status\fP command.
.H 3 "ax25 maxframe" " [\fIcount\fP]"
Display or set the maximum number of frames that will be allowed to remain
unacknowledged at any time on AX.25 connections. This number cannot
be greater than 7.
Note that the maximum outstanding frame count only works with
virtual connections, UI frames are not affected.
The default is 7 frames.
See the \fBSetting Paclen, Maxframe, MTU, MSS and Window\fP chapter
for more information.
.H 3 "ax25 mycall" " [\fIax25_addr\fP]"
Display or set the default local AX.25 address. The standard format is used,
eg. KA9Q-0 or WB6RQN-5.
This command must be given before any \fBattach\fP commands
using AX.25 mode are given.
.H 3 "ax25 paclen" " [\fIsize\fP]"
Limit the size of I-fields on new AX.25 connections. If IP
datagrams or fragments larger than this are transmitted, they will be
transparently fragmented at the AX.25 level, sent as a series of I
frames, and reassembled back into a complete IP datagram or fragment at
the other end of the link. To have any effect on IP datagrams,
this parameter should be less than or equal to
the MTU of the associated interface.
The default is 256 bytes.
See the \fBSetting Paclen, Maxframe, MTU, MSS and Window\fP chapter
for more information.
.H 3 "ax25 pthresh" " [\fIsize\fP]"
Display or set the poll threshold to be used for new AX.25 Version 2
connections. The poll threshold controls retransmission behavior as
follows. If the oldest unacknowledged I frame size is less than the poll
threshold, it will be sent with the poll (P) bit set if a timeout occurs.
If the oldest unacknowledged I frame size is equal to or greater than the
threshold, then a RR or RNR frame, as appropriate, with the poll bit set
will be sent if a timeout occurs.
.P
The idea behind the poll threshold is that the extra time needed to send a
"small" I frame instead of a supervisory frame when polling after a timeout
is small, and since there is a good chance the I frame will have to be sent
anyway (i.e., if it were lost previously) then you might as well send it as
the poll. But if the I frame is large, send a supervisory (RR/RNR) poll
instead to determine first if retransmitting the oldest unacknowledged
I frame is necessary, the timeout might have been caused by a lost
acknowledgement. This is obviously a tradeoff, so experiment with the
poll threshold setting. The default is 64 bytes.
.H 3 "ax25 reset" " \fIaxcb_addr\fP"
Delete the AX.25 control block at the specified address.
The control block address can be found with the \fBax25 status\fP command.
.H 3 "ax25 retry" " [\fIcount\fP]"
Limit the number of successive unsuccessful transmission attempts on
new AX.25 connections. If this limit is exceeded, the connection
is abandoned and all queued data is deleted.
A \fIcount\fP of 0 allows unlimited transmission attempts.
The default is 10 tries.
.H 3 "ax25 route" " [stat]"
Display the AX.25 routing table that
specifies the interface and digipeaters to be used in reaching a given station.
MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 4 "ax25 route add" " [permanent] \fIinterface\fP default|\fIax25_addr\fP [\fIdigipeater\fP ...]"
Add an entry to the AX.25 routing table. An automatic \fBax25 route add\fP
is executed if digipeaters are specified in an AX.25 \fBconnect\fP
command, or if a connection is received from a remote station.
Such automatic routing table entries won't override locally
created \fBpermanent\fP entries, however. MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 4 "ax25 route list" " [\fIax25_addr\fP ...]"
TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "ax25 status" " [\fIaxcb_addr\fP]"
Without an argument, display a one-line summary of each AX.25 control block.
If the address of a particular control block is specified, the contents of
that control block are shown in more detail.
.H 3 "ax25 t1" " [\fImilliseconds\fP]"
Display or set the AX.25 retransmission timer.
The default is 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).
MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "ax25 t2" " [\fImilliseconds\fP]"
Display or set the AX.25 acknowledge delay timer.
The default is 300 milliseconds (0.3 seconds).
MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "ax25 t3" " [\fImilliseconds\fP]"
Display or set the AX.25 idle poll timer.
The default is 900000 milliseconds (15 minutes).
MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "ax25 t4" " [\fImilliseconds\fP]"
Display or set the AX.25 busy timer.
The default is 60000 milliseconds (1 minute).
MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "ax25 t5" " [\fImilliseconds\fP]"
Display or set the AX.25 idle disconnect timer.
The default is 3600000 milliseconds (60 minutes).
MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "ax25 version" " [1|2]"
Display or set the version of the AX.25 protocol to attempt to use on
new connections. The default is 2 (the version
that uses the poll/final bits).
.H 3 "ax25 window" " [\fIsize\fP]"
Set the number of bytes that can be pending on an AX.25 receive queue
beyond which I frames will be answered with RNR (Receiver Not Ready)
responses. This presently applies only to suspended interactive AX.25
sessions, since incoming I frames containing network (IP, NET/ROM) packets
are always processed immediately and are not placed on the receive queue.
However, when an AX.25 connection carries both interactive
and network packet traffic, a RNR generated because of
backlogged interactive traffic will also stop network
packet traffic.
The default is 2048 bytes.
