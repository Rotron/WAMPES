.H 2 "hostname" " [\fIhostname\fP]"
Display or set the local host's name. By convention this should
be the same as the host's primary domain name. This string is
used in greeting messages of various network
servers, and in the command line prompt.
Note that \fBhostname\fP does NOT set the system's IP address.
.P
If \fIhostname\fP is the same as the name of an attached interface,
\fIhostname\fP will be substituted by the canonical host name
which corresponds to the IP address of that interface.
