.H 2 "remote" " [-p \fIport\fP] [-k \fIkey\fP] [-a \fIkickaddr\fP] \fIhostid\fP exit|reset|kick"
Send a UDP packet to the specified host commanding it
to exit the \fBWAMPES\fP or \fBNOS\fP program, reset the processor,
or force a retransmission on TCP connections. For this
command to be accepted, the remote system must be running the \fBremote\fP
server, and the port number used by the local \fBremote\fP command must match
the port number used by the remote server.
If the port numbers do not match, or if the remote server is not running
on the target system, the command packet is ignored. Even if the
command is accepted there is no acknowledgement.
.P
If the \fB-p\fP option is not specified, port 1234 will be used.
.P
The \fBkick\fP command forces a retransmission timeout on all
TCP connections that the remote node may have with the local node.
If the \fB-a\fP option is used, connections to the specified host are
kicked instead. No key is required for the \fBkick\fP subcommand.
.P
The \fBexit\fP subcommand is mainly useful for
restarting the \fBWAMPES\fP program on a remote
unattended system after a configuration file has been updated. The
remote system should invoke the \fBWAMPES\fP program automatically upon booting,
preferably from \fB/etc/inittab\fP.
For example:
.DS I
.ft CW
net :23456:respawn:env TZ=MST7MDT /tcp/net
.ft P
.DE
.H 3 "remote -s" " \fIkey\fP"
The \fBexit\fP and \fBreset\fP subcommands of \fBremote\fP require a password.
The password is set on the server with the \fB-s\fP option,
and it is specified to the client with the \fB-k\fP option.
If no password is set with the \fB-s\fP option,
then the \fBexit\fP and \fBreset\fP subcommands are disabled.
