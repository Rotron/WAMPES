.H 2 "connect" " \fIax25_addr\fP [\fIdigipeater\fP ...]"
Initiate a "vanilla" AX.25 session to the specified \fIax25_addr\fP.
Up to 8 optional digipeaters may be given, note that the word
\fBvia\fP is NOT needed.
Data sent on this session goes out in conventional AX.25 packets
with no upper layer protocol. The de-facto presentation
standard format is used, in that each packet holds one line of
text, terminated by a carriage return. A single AX.25
connection may be used for terminal-to-terminal, IP and NET/ROM
traffic, with the three types of data being automatically separated
by their AX.25 Level 3 Protocol IDs.
