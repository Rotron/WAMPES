.H 2 "rip" " \fIsubcommand\fP"
These commands control the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) service.
.H 3 "rip accept" " \fIhostid\fP"
Remove the specified host from the RIP filter table, allowing future
broadcasts from that host to be accepted.
.H 3 "rip add" " \fIhostid\fP \fIseconds\fP [\fIflags\fP]"
Add an entry to the RIP broadcast table. The IP routing table will be sent
to \fIhostid\fP every interval of \fIseconds\fP. If
\fIflags\fP is specified as 1, then "split horizon" processing will
be performed
for this destination. That is, any IP routing table entries pointing to the
interface that will be used to send this update will be removed from the
update. If split horizon processing is not specified, then all routing
table entries except those marked "private" will be sent in each update.
Private entries are never sent in RIP packets.
.P
Triggered updates are always done. That is, any change in the routing table
that causes a previously reachable destination to become unreachable will
trigger an update that advertises the destination with metric 15, defined to
mean "infinity".
.P
Note that for RIP packets to be sent properly to a broadcast address, there
must exist correct IP routing and ARP table entries that will first steer
the broadcast to the correct interface and then place the correct link-level
broadcast address in the link-level destination field. If a standard IP
broadcast address convention is used (eg. 44.255.255.255),
then chances are you already have the necessary IP routing table entry, but
unusual subnet or cluster-addressed networks may require special attention.
However, an \fBarp add\fP command will be required to translate this address to
the appropriate link level broadcast address. For example:
.DS I
.ft CW
arp add 44.255.255.255 ax25 QST-0
.ft P
.DE
for an AX.25 packet radio channel.
.H 3 "rip drop" " \fIhostid\fP"
Remove an entry from the RIP broadcast table.
.H 3 "rip merge" " [on|off]"
This flag controls an experimental feature for consolidating redundant
entries in the IP routing table. When rip merging is enabled, the table is
scanned after processing each RIP update. An entry is considered redundant
if the target(s) it covers would be routed identically by a less "specific"
entry already in the table. That is, the target address(es) specified
by the entry in question must also match the target addresses of the
less specific entry and the two entries must have the same interface
and gateway fields. For example, if the routing table contains
.TS
center tab(;) ;
lB lB lB lB lB lB lB lB
l l l l l l l l.
Dest;Len;Interface;Gateway;Metric;P;Timer;Use
1.2.3.4;32;ethernet0;128.96.1.2;1;0;0;0
1.2.3;24;ethernet0;128.96.1.2;1;0;0;0
.TE
.SP
then the first entry would be deleted as redundant since packets sent to
1.2.3.4 will still be routed correctly by the second entry. Note that the
relative metrics of the entries are ignored.
The default is \fBoff\fP.
.H 3 "rip refuse" " \fIhostid\fP"
Refuse to accept RIP updates from the specified host by adding the
host to the RIP filter table. It may be later removed with the
\fBrip accept\fP command.
.H 3 "rip request" " \fIhostid\fP"
Send a RIP Request packet to the specified host, causing it to reply
with a RIP Response packet containing its routing table.
.H 3 "rip status"
Display RIP status, including a count of the number of packets sent
and received, the number of requests and responses, the number of
unknown RIP packet types, and the number of refused RIP updates from hosts
in the filter table. A list of the addresses and intervals
to which periodic RIP updates are being sent is also shown, along with
the contents of the filter table.
.H 3 "rip trace" " [0|1|2]"
This variable controls the tracing of incoming and outgoing RIP packets.
Setting it to 0 disables all RIP tracing. A value of 1 causes changes
in the routing table to be displayed, while packets that cause no changes
cause no output. Setting the variable to 2 produces maximum output,
including tracing of RIP packets that cause no change in the routing table.
The default is 0.
