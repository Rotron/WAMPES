.H 2 "trace" " [\fIinterface\fP [off|\fIbtio\fP [\fItracefile\fP]]]"
Controls packet tracing by the interface drivers. Specific bits enable
tracing of the various interfaces and the amount of information produced.
Tracing is controlled on a per-interface basis. Without arguments, \fBtrace\fP
gives a list of all defined interfaces and their tracing status.
Output can be limited to a single interface by specifying it, and the
control flags can be change by specifying them as well. The flags are
given as a hexadecimal number which is interpreted as follows:
.DS I
.ft CW
    O - Enable tracing of output packets if 1, disable if 0
    I - Enable tracing of input packets if 1, disable if 0
    T - Controls type of tracing:
	0 - Protocol headers are decoded, but data is not displayed
	1 - Protocol headers are decoded, and data (but not the
	    headers themselves) are displayed as ASCII characters,
	    64 characters/line. Unprintable characters are displayed
	    as periods.
	2 - Protocol headers are decoded, and the entire packet
	    (headers AND data) is also displayed in hexadecimal
	    and ASCII, 16 characters per line.
    B - Broadcast filter flag. If set, only packets specifically addressed
	to this node will be traced, broadcast packets will not be displayed.
.ft P
.DE
If \fItracefile\fP is not specified, tracing will be to the console.
