.H 2 "trace" " [\fIinterface\fP [\fIflags\fP|subcommand [\fItracefile\fP]]]"
Control packet tracing by the interface drivers.
Specific bits in \fIflags\fP enable tracing of the various interfaces
and the amount of information produced.
Tracing is controlled on a per-interface basis.
Without arguments, \fBtrace\fP displays a list of all defined interfaces
and their tracing status.
Output can be limited to a single interface by specifying it,
and the control flags can be changed by specifying them as well.
\fIflags\fP is constructed from the logical OR of the following flag bits:
.DS
.TS
center box tab(;) ;
cB | cB
l | l.
Flag;Meaning
_
0001;Trace output packets
0010;Trace input packets
_
0000;Decode headers
0100;Print data (but not headers) in ASCII
0200;Print headers and data in HEX and ASCII
_
1000;Trace only packets addressed to me, suppress broadcasts
_
2000;Print all packet bytes (input and output), no interpretation
.TE
.DE
Instead of defining the trace flags numerically one of the following
subcommands may be given:
.DS
.TS
center box tab(;) ;
cB | cB
l | l.
Subcommand;Meaning
_
-ascii;Decode headers only
-broadcast;Disable trace of broadcasts
-hex;Print data (but not headers) in ASCII
-input;Disable input trace
-output;Disable output trace
-raw;Disable raw packet dumps
ascii;Print data (but not headers) in ASCII
broadcast;Enable trace of broadcasts
hex;Print headers and data in HEX and ASCII
input;Enable input trace
off;Turn off all trace output
output;Enable output trace
raw;Enable raw packet dumps
.TE
.DE
If \fItracefile\fP is not specified, tracing will be to the console.
