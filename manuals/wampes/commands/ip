.H 2 "ip" " \fIsubcommand\fP"
These commands control the Internet Protocol (IP) service.
.H 3 "ip address" " [\fIhostid\fP]"
Display or set the default local IP address. This command must be given before
an \fBattach\fP command if it is to be used as the default IP address for
that interface.
.H 3 "ip rtimer" " [\fIseconds\fP]"
Display or set the IP fragment reassembly timeout. The default is 30 seconds.
.H 3 "ip status"
Display Internet Protocol (IP) statistics, such as total packet counts
and error counters of various types.
.H 3 "ip ttl" " [\fIhops\fP]"
Display or set the default time-to-live value placed in each outgoing IP
datagram. This limits the number of switch hops the datagram will be allowed to
take. The idea is to bound the lifetime of the packet should it become caught
in a routing loop, so make the value slightly larger than the number of
hops across the network you expect to transit packets.
The default is 255 hops.
