.H 2 "close" " [\fIsession#\fP]"
Close the specified session, without an argument, close the
current session. On an AX.25 session this command initiates a
disconnect. On a FTP or Telnet session this command sends a
FIN (i.e., initiates a close) on the session's TCP connection.
This is an alternative to asking the remote server to initiate a
close (QUIT to FTP, or the logout command appropriate for the
remote system in the case of Telnet). When either FTP or Telnet
sees the incoming half of a TCP connection close, it
automatically responds by closing the outgoing half of the
connection. \fBclose\fP is more graceful than the \fBreset\fP command, in
that it is less likely to leave the remote TCP in a "half-open"
state.
