.H 2 "log" " [stop|\fIfilename\fP]"
Display the current log filename or set the filename for logging
server sessions. If \fBstop\fP is given as the argument,
logging is terminated (the servers themselves are unaffected).
If a file name is given as an argument, server session log
entries will be appended to it.
