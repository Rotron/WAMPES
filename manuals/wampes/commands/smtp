.H 2 "smtp" " \fIsubcommand\fP"
These commands control the Simple Message Transport Protocol (SMTP) service
(and all other mail delivery clients).
.H 3 "smtp kick" " [\fIdestination\fP]"
Run through the outgoing mail queue and attempt to deliver any pending mail.
If \fIdestination\fP is specified try only to deliver mail to this system.
This command allows the user to "kick" the mail system manually.
Normally, this command is periodically invoked by a timer
whenever \fBWAMPES\fP is running (see \fBsmtp timer\fP). MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "smtp list"
List the current jobs. MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "smtp maxclients" " [\fIcount\fP]"
Display or set the maximum number of simultaneous outgoing mail sessions
that will be allowed. The default is 10, reduce it if network congestion
is a problem.
.H 3 "smtp timer" " [\fIseconds\fP]"
Display or set the interval between scans of the outbound
mail queue. For example, \fBsmtp timer 600\fP will cause the system to check
for outgoing mail every 10 minutes and attempt to deliver anything it finds,
subject of course to the \fBsmtp maxclients\fP limit. Setting a value of zero
disables
queue scanning altogether, note that this is the default!
