Display or set Telnet's end-of-line behavior when in remote echo mode.
In \fBstandard\fP mode, each key is sent as-is.
In \fBnull\fP mode, carriage returns are translated to line feeds.
This command is not necessary with all UNIX systems,
use it only when you find that a particular system responds to line feeds
but not carriage returns.
Only SunOS release 3.2 seems to exhibit this behavior, later releases are fixed.
The default is \fBstandard\fP.
