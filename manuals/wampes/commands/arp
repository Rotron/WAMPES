.H 2 "arp"
Display the Address Resolution Protocol table that maps IP addresses
to their subnet (link) addresses on subnetworks capable of broadcasting.
For each IP address entry the subnet type (eg. \fBax25\fP, \fBnetrom\fP), link
address and time to expiration is shown. If the link address is currently
unknown, the number of IP datagrams awaiting resolution is also shown.
.H 3 "arp add" " \fIhostid\fP ax25|netrom \fIlink_addr\fP"
Add a permanent entry to the table. It will not time out as
will an automatically created entry, but must be removed with the
\fBarp drop\fP command.
.H 3 "arp drop" " \fIhostid\fP ax25|netrom"
Remove the specified entry from the ARP table.
.H 3 "arp flush"
Drop all automatically created entries in the ARP table, permanent
entries are not affected.
.H 3 "arp publish" " \fIhostid\fP ax25|netrom \fIlink_addr\fP"
The \fBarp publish\fP command is similar to the \fBarp add\fP command,
but the system will also respond to any ARP request it sees on the network
that seeks the specified address.
This is commonly referred to as "proxy arp",
and is considered a fairly dangerous tool.
The basic idea is that if you have two machines,
one of which is on the air with a TNC,
and the second one of which is connected to the first with a slip link,
you might want the first machine to publish it's own AX.25 address
as the right answer for arp queries addressing the second machine.
This way, the rest of the world doesn't know the second machine
isn't really on the air.
(Use this feature with great care.)
