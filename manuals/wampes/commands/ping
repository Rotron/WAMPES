.H 2 "ping" " [\fIsubcommand\fP]"
Without an argument,
display the Ping table,
which lists statistics on all active repetitive pings.
.H 3 "ping clear"
Stop all active repetitive pings, and clear the Ping table.
.H 3 "ping \fIhostid\fP" " [\fIpacketsize\fP [\fIinterval\fP]]"
Ping (send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to) the specified host.
ECHO_REQUEST datagrams have an IP and ICMP header,
followed by a \fBstruct timeval\fP,
and an arbitrary number of pad bytes used to fill out the packet.
Default datagram length is 64 bytes,
but this can be changed by specifying \fIpacketsize\fP.
The minimum value allowed for \fIpacketsize\fP is 8 bytes.
If \fIpacketsize\fP is smaller than 16 bytes,
there is not enough room for timing information.
In this case the round-trip times are not displayed.
.P
If \fIinterval\fP is specified,
pings will be repeated at the specified interval (in seconds)
until the \fBping clear\fP command is issued,
otherwise a single, "one shot" ping is done.
Responses to one-shot pings appear asynchronously on the command screen,
while responses from repetitive pings are stored in the Ping table.
