.H 3 "ping \fIhostid\fP" " [\fIpacketsize\fP [\fIinterval\fP]]"
Ping (send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to) the specified host.
ECHO_REQUEST datagrams have an IP and ICMP header,
followed by a \fBstruct timeval\fP,
and an arbitrary number of pad bytes used to fill out the packet.
Default datagram length is 64 bytes,
but this can be changed by specifying \fIpacketsize\fP.
The minimum value allowed for \fIpacketsize\fP is 8 bytes.
If \fIpacketsize\fP is smaller than 16 bytes,
there is not enough room for timing information.
In this case the round-trip times are not displayed.
.P
If \fIinterval\fP is specified, pings will be repeated indefinitely
at the specified interval (in seconds),
otherwise a single, "one shot" ping is done.
Responses to one-shot pings appear asynchronously on the command screen.
