.H 2 "ifconfig" " [\fIinterface\fP [[\fIsubcommand\fP \fIparameter\fP] ...]"
Without arguments display the status of all interfaces.
When only \fIinterface\fP is given, the status of this interface is displayed.
Multiple subcommand/parameter pairs can be put on one line.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP broadcast" " \fIaddr\fP"
Set the broadcast address of \fIinterface\fP to \fIaddr\fP.
This is related to the \fBnetmask\fP sub-command.
See also the \fBarp\fP command.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP encapsulation" " \fIencapsulation\fP"
Set the encapsulation for \fIinterface\fP to \fIencapsulation\fP.
\fIEncapsulation\fP may be one of
\fBnone\fP,
\fBax25ui\fP,
\fBax25i\fP,
\fBkissui\fP,
\fBkissi\fP,
\fBslip\fP,
\fBvjslip\fP,
\fBnetrom\fP,
or
\fBnrs\fP.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP forward" " \fIinterface-2\fP"
When a forward is defined, all output for \fIinterface\fP is redirected to
\fIinterface-2\fP. To remove the forward, set \fIinterface-2\fP to \fIinterface\fP.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP ipaddress" " \fIaddr\fP"
Set the IP address to \fIaddr\fP for this interface. This might be necessary
when a system acts as a gateway.
See also the \fBhostname\fP and \fBip address\fP commands.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP linkaddress" " \fIhardware-dependent\fP"
Set the hardware dependent address for this interface. For
AX.25 this can be the callsign, for ethernet an ethernet
address.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP mtu" " \fIparameter\fP"
Set the maximum transfer unit to \fIparameter\fP octeds (bytes).
See the \fBSetting Paclen, Maxframe, MTU, MSS and Window\fP chapter
for more information.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP netmask" " \fIaddress\fP"
Set the sub-net mask for this interface.
The \fIaddress\fP takes the form of an IP address
with 1's in the network and subnet parts of the address,
and 0's in the host part of the address.
Sample: ifconfig ec0 netmask 0xffffff00 for a class C network (24 bits).
This is related to the \fBbroadcast\fP sub-command.
See also the \fBroute\fP command.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP rxbuf" " \fIsize\fP"
Set the receive buffer size.
This value is currently not used by \fBWAMPES\fP.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP txqlen" " \fIsize\fP"
TO BE WRITTEN.
