.H 2 "ifconfig" " [\fIinterface\fP [[\fIsubcommand\fP \fIparameter\fP] ...]"
Without arguments display the status of all interfaces.
When only \fIinterface\fP is given, the status of that interface is displayed.
Multiple subcommand/parameter pairs can be put on one line.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP autoroute" " \fBon\fP|\fBoff\fP"
Enable or disable the automatic learning of routes through this interface.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP broadcast" " \fIhostid\fP"
Set the broadcast address of \fIinterface\fP to \fIhostid\fP.
This is related to the \fBnetmask\fP subcommand.
See also the \fBarp\fP command.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP encapsulation" " \fIencapsulation\fP"
Set the encapsulation for \fIinterface\fP to \fIencapsulation\fP.
\fIEncapsulation\fP may be one of:
.VL 20 2
.LI \fBnone\fP
No encapsulation.
.LI \fBslip\fP
Serial Line Internet Protocol.
Encapsulates IP datagrams directly in SLIP frames without a link
header. This is for operation on point-to-point lines and is compatible
with 4.2BSD UNIX SLIP.
.LI \fBvjslip\fP
Compressed SLIP.
.LI \fBax25ui\fP,\ \fBax25i\fP
Similar to \fBslip\fP, except that an AX.25 header
is added to the datagram before SLIP encoding.
.LI \fBkissui\fP,\ \fBkissi\fP
Similar to \fBslip\fP, except that an AX.25 header
and a KISS TNC control header
is added to the datagram before SLIP encoding.
.LI \fBnetrom\fP
Adds a NET/ROM network header to the datagram.
.LI \fBnrs\fP
Adds an AX.25 header,
then encodes the frame using
the NET/ROM asynchronous framing technique
for communication with a local NET/ROM TNC.
.LE 1
For AX.25 based encapsulations UI frames (datagram mode) will be used
if any one of the following conditions is true,
otherwise I frames (virtual circuit mode) will be used:
.BL 5 1
.LI
the "low delay" bit is set in the IP type-of-service field.
.LI
the "reliability" bit is NOT set in the IP type-of-service field,
and encapsulation is \fBax25ui\fP, \fBkissui\fP, or \fBnrs\fP.
.LI
the destination is the broadcast address
(this is helpful when broadcasting on an interface
that uses \fBax25i\fP or \fBkissi\fP encapsulation).
.LE 1
The setting of the IP type-of-service field may be ignored
by using the \fBax25 ignoretos\fP command.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP forward" " \fIinterface2\fP"
When a forward is defined, all output for \fIinterface\fP is redirected to
\fIinterface2\fP. To remove the forward, set \fIinterface2\fP to \fIinterface\fP.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP ipaddress" " \fIhostid\fP"
Set the IP address to \fIhostid\fP for this interface. This might be necessary
when a system acts as a gateway.
See also the \fBip address\fP command.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP linkaddress" " \fIhardware-dependent\fP"
Set the hardware dependent address for this interface. For
AX.25 this can be the callsign, for ethernet an ethernet
address.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP mtu" " \fIparameter\fP"
Set the maximum transfer unit to \fIparameter\fP octeds (bytes).
See the \fBSetting Paclen, Maxframe, MTU, MSS and Window\fP chapter
for more information.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP netmask" " \fIaddress\fP"
Set the subnet mask for this interface.
The \fIaddress\fP takes the form of an IP address
with 1's in the network and subnet parts of the address,
and 0's in the host part of the address.
Example:
.DS I
.ft CW
ifconfig ec0 netmask 0xffffff00
.ft P
.DE
for a class C network (24 bits).
This is related to the \fBbroadcast\fP subcommand.
See also the \fBroute\fP command.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP rxbuf" " \fIsize\fP"
Set the receive buffer size.
This value is currently not used by \fBWAMPES\fP.
.H 3 "ifconfig \fIinterface\fP txqlen" " \fIsize\fP"
Set the transmit queue limit
(maximum number of packets waiting in the transmit queue).
If set to 0 the transmit queue is unlimited.
