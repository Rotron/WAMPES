.H 2 "sntp" " \fIsubcommand\fP"
TO BE WRITTEN.
.H 3 "sntp add" " \fIhostid\fP [\fIinterval\fP]"
Add \fIhostid\fP to the list of sntp servers.
\fIinterval\fP specifies the poll interval in seconds (default 3333).
.H 3 "sntp drop" " \fIhostid\fP"
Remove \fIhostid\fP from the list of sntp servers.
.H 3 "sntp status"
List the currently configured sntp servers, along with
statistics on how many polls and replies have been exchanged
with each one, response times, etc.
.H 3 "sntp step_threshold" " [\fIstep_threshold\fP]"
Display or set the step threshold (measured in seconds). If the
required time adjustment is below the step threshold, the
adjtime() system call will be used to slow down or to accelerate
the clock, otherwise the clock will be stepped using
settimeofday().
The default is 1 second.
.H 3 "sntp sys"
Display the sntp server configuration.
.H 4 "sntp sys leap" " [\fIleap\fP]"
Display or set the sntp server leap indicator. This is a
two-bit code warning of an impending leap second to be
inserted/deleted in the last minute of the current day, coded as
follows:
.DS
.TS
center box tab(;) ;
cB | cB
l | l.
Value;Meaning
_
0;no warning
1;last minute has 61 seconds
2;last minute has 59 seconds)
3;alarm condition (clock not synchronized)
.TE
.DE
The default is 0.
.H 4 "sntp sys precision" " [\fIprecision\fP]"
Display or set the sntp server precision. This is an eight-bit
signed integer indicating the precision of the local clock, in
seconds to the nearest power of two. The values that normally
appear in this field range from -6 for mains-frequency clocks to
-18 for microsecond clocks found in some workstations.
The default is -10.
.H 4 "sntp sys refid" " [\fIrefid\fP]"
Display or set the sntp server reference identifier. This is
identifying the particular reference clock. In the case of
stratum 0 (unspecified) or stratum 1 (primary reference), this
is a string of up to 4 characters. While not enumerated as part
of the NTP specification, the following are representative ASCII
identifiers:
.DS
.TS
center box tab(;) ;
cB | cB | cB
l | l | l.
Stratum;Code;Meaning
_
0;ascii;generic time service other than NTP, such as
;;ACTS (Automated Computer Time Service),
;;TIME (UDP/Time Protocol),
;;TSP (TSP UNIX time protocol),
;;DTSS (Digital Time Synchronization Service), etc.
1;ATOM;calibrated atomic clock
1;VLF;VLF radio (OMEGA, etc.)
1;callsign;Generic radio
1;LORC;LORAN-C radionavigation system
1;GOES;Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
1;GPS;Global Positioning Service
2;address;secondary reference (four-octet Internet address
;;of the NTP server)
.TE
.DE
The default is UNIX.
.H 4 "sntp sys reftime"
Display the sntp server reference time.
.H 4 "sntp sys rootdelay" " [\fIrootdelay\fP]"
Display or set the sntp server root delay. This is a floating
point number indicating the total roundtrip delay to the primary
reference source, in seconds. Note that this variable can take
on both positive and negative values, depending on the relative
time and frequency errors. The values that normally appear in
this field range from negative values of a few milliseconds to
positive values of several hundred milliseconds.
The default is 0.
.H 4 "sntp sys rootdispersion" " [\fIrootdispersion\fP]"
Display or set the sntp server root dispersion. This is a
floating point number indicating the maximum error relative to
the primary reference source, in seconds. The values that
normally appear in this field range from zero to several hundred
milliseconds.
The default is 0.
.H 4 "sntp sys stratum" " [\fIstratum\fP]"
Display or set the sntp server stratum. This is a eight-bit
integer indicating the stratum level of the local clock, with
values defined as follows:
.DS
.TS
center box tab(;) ;
cB | cB
l | l.
Stratum;Meaning
_
0;unspecified or unavailable
1;primary reference (e.g., radio clock)
2-15;secondary reference (via NTP or SNTP)
16-255;reserved
.TE
.DE
The default is 1.
.H 3 "sntp trace" " [on|off]"
Enable or disable sntp tracing.
The default is \fBoff\fP.
