.H 2 "asystat" " [\fIinterface\fP ...]"
Display statistics on the specified or all
attached asynchronous communications interfaces.
The display for each interface consists of three lines:
.BL
.LI
The first line shows the interface name,
the state (\fBUP\fP or \fBDOWN\fP),
and the speed in bits per second.
.LI
The second line shows receiver (RX) event
counts: the total number of read system calls, received
characters, and the receiver high water mark. The receiver high water
mark is the maximum number of characters ever read from the
device during a single read system call. This is useful for
monitoring system interrupt latency margins as it shows how
close the port hardware has come to overflowing due to the
inability of the CPU to respond in time.
The high water mark is reset to 0 after \fBasystat\fP has
displayed its value.
.LI
The third line shows transmit (TX) statistics, including the total
number of write system calls and transmitted characters.
.LE
