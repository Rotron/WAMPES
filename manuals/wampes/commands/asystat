.H 2 "asystat"
Display statistics on attached asynchronous communications
interfaces, if any. The display for each port consists of three
lines.
.P
The first line gives the port label and the speed in
bits per second.
.P
The second line shows receiver (RX) event
counts: the total number of read system calls, received
characters, and the receiver high water mark. The high water
mark is the maximum number of characters ever read from the
device during a single system call. This is useful for
monitoring system interrupt latency margins as it shows how
close the port hardware has come to overflowing due to the
inability of the CPU to respond in time.
.P
The third line shows transmit (TX) statistics, including the total
number of write system calls and transmitted characters.
