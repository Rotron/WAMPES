.H 2 "tcp" " \fIsubcommand\fP"
These commands control the Transmission Control Protocol service.
.H 3 "tcp irtt" " [\fImilliseconds\fP]"
Display or set the initial round trip time estimate, in milliseconds, to be
used for new TCP connections until they can measure and adapt to the
actual value. The default is 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).
Increasing this when operating
over slow channels will avoid the flurry of retransmissions that would
otherwise occur as the smoothed estimate settles down at the correct
value. Note that this command should be given before servers are started in
order for it to have effect on incoming connections.
.P
TCP also keeps a cache of measured round trip times and mean
deviations (MDEV) for current and recent destinations. Whenever a new
TCP connection is opened, the system first looks in this cache. If the
destination is found, the cached IRTT and MDEV values are used. If not,
the default IRTT value mentioned above is used, along with a MDEV of 0.
This feature is fully automatic, and it can improve performance greatly
when a series of connections are opened and closed to a given destination
(eg. a series of FTP file transfers or directory listings).
.H 3 "tcp kick" " \fItcb_addr\fP"
If there is unacknowledged
data on the send queue of the specified TCB, this command forces
an immediate retransmission.
.H 3 "tcp mss" " [\fIsize\fP]"
Display or set the TCP Maximum Segment Size in bytes that will be sent on all
outgoing TCP connect request (SYN segments). This tells the remote end the
size of the largest segment (packet) it may send. Changing MSS affects
only future connections, existing connections are unaffected.
The default is 512 bytes.
.H 3 "tcp reset" " \fItcb_addr\fP"
Deletes the TCP control block at the specified address.
.H 3 "tcp rtt" " \fItcb_addr\fP \fImilliseconds\fP"
Replaces the automatically computed round trip time in the specified TCB
with the rtt in milliseconds. This command is useful to speed up
recovery from a series of lost packets since it provides a manual bypass
around the normal backoff retransmission timing mechanisms.
.H 3 "tcp status" " [\fItcb_addr\fP]"
Without arguments, displays several TCP-level statistics, plus a summary of
all existing TCP connections, including TCB address, send and receive queue
sizes, local and remote sockets, and connection state. If \fItcb_addr\fP is
specified, a more detailed dump of the specified TCB is generated, including
send and receive sequence numbers and timer information.
.H 3 "tcp syndata" " [on|off]"
Display or set the TCP SYN+data piggybacking flag.
Some TCP implementations cannot handle SYN+data together.
The default is \fBoff\fP.
.H 3 "tcp trace" " [on|off]"
Display or set the TCP trace flag.
The default is \fBoff\fP.
.H 3 "tcp window" " [\fIsize\fP]"
Display or set the default receive window size in bytes to be used by TCP
when creating new connections. Existing connections are unaffected.
The default is 2048 bytes.
