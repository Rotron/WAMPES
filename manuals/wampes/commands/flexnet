.H 2 "flexnet" " \fIsubcommand\fP"
These commands control the FLEXNET service.
.H 3 "flexnet dest" " [\fIax25_addr\fP]"
Display all known, or the specified, FLEXNET destination,
together with the list of neighbors
through which the destination can be reached.
The number in parentheses after each neighbor is the propagation delay
to the destination through this neighbor.
The neighbor list is sorted by this delay,
the best neighbor
(the one which actually will be used)
is listed first.
The delay is measured in 100 millisecond units,
a value of zero is to be taken as infinity.
.H 3 "flexnet destdebug"
Display all known FLEXNET destinations,
together with the list of all neighbors.
Two numbers are printed in parentheses after each neighbor.
The \fBD\fPelay value is the propagation delay to the destination
through this neighbor.
The \fBL\fPast value is the delay our node sent to this neighbor,
telling it the propagation delay to the destination through our node.
The delays are measured in 100 millisecond units,
a value of zero is to be taken as infinity.
.H 3 "flexnet link"
Without an argument, display the FLEXNET link table,
which contains all known FLEXNET neighbors.
The fields are as follows:
.VL 20 2
.LI \fBCall\fP
The call sign and SSID range of this neighbor.
.LI \fBRemote\fP
The propagation delay to this neighbor as measured by the neighbor.
.LI \fBLocal\fP
The propagation delay to this neighbor as measured by the our node.
.LI \fBSmooth\fP
The smoothed, average propagation delay to this neighbor.
.LI \fBP\fP
If this column contains a \fBP\fP,
then the link was created manually,
and is \fBpermanent\fP.
A permanent link can only be removed
with the \fBflexnet link delete\fP command.
.LI \fBT\fP
The state of the routing token encoded as follows:
.VL 10 2 1
.LI \fBN\fP
Our node does not have the token, and did not requested it.
.LI \fBW\fP
Our node does not have the token, but did requested it.
.LI \fBY\fP
Our node has the token.
.LE
.LI \fBState\fP
The state of the AX.25 link to this neighbor.
.LE
.H 4 "flexnet link add" " \fIax25_addr\fP"
Add a permanent entry to the FLEXNET link table.
.H 4 "flexnet link delete" " \fIax25_addr\fP"
Remove the specified entry from the FLEXNET link table.
.H 3 "flexnet query" " \fIax25_addr\fP"
Display the path to the specified FLEXNET destination. Call signs shown
in capital letters along the path support the FLEXNET protocol,
those in lower-case letters do not.
