.H 2 "param" " \fIinterface\fP [\fIname\fP|\fInumber\fP [\fIvalue\fP]]"
Invoke a device-specific control routine.
The following parameter names are recognized by the \fBparam\fP command,
but not all are supported by each device type.
Most commands deal only with half-duplex packet radio interfaces.

.SP
Depending on the interface type, some parameters can be read back by
omitting a new value. This is not possible with KISS TNCs as
there are no KISS commands for reading back previously sent
parameters.
.P
On a KISS TNC interface, the \fBparam\fP command generates and sends
control packets to the TNC. Data bytes are treated as decimal.
For example,
.DS I
.ft CW
param ax0 TxDelay 255
.ft P
.DE
will set the keyup timer
(type field = 1) on the KISS TNC configured as ax0 to 2.55
seconds (255 x .01 sec). On all asy interfaces (slip, ax25, kiss,
nrs) the \fBparam\fP \fIinterface\fP \fBSpeed\fP command allows the baud rate to
be read or set.
.P
The implementation of this command for the various interface
drivers is incomplete and subject to change.
