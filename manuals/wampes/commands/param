.H 2 "param" " \fIinterface\fP [\fIparam\fP ...]"
Invoke a device-specific control routine. On a KISS TNC
interface, this sends control packets to the TNC. Data bytes are
treated as decimal. For example, \fBparam ax0 1 255\fP will set the keyup
timer (type field = 1) on the KISS TNC configured as ax0 to 2.55 seconds
(255 x .01 sec). On a SLIP interface, the \fBparam\fP command allows the baud
rate to be read (without arguments) or set. The implementation of this
command for the various interface drivers is incomplete and subject to
change. MORE TO BE WRITTEN.
