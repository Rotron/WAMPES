.H 2 "echo" " [accept|refuse]"
Display or set the flag controlling client Telnet's response to
a remote WILL ECHO offer.
The default is \fBaccept\fP.
.P
The Telnet presentation protocol specifies that in the absence
of a negotiated agreement to the contrary, neither end echoes
data received from the other. In this mode, a Telnet client
session echoes keyboard input locally and nothing is actually
sent until a carriage return is typed. Local line editing is
also performed, see the \fBConsole modes\fP chapter.
.P
When communicating from keyboard to keyboard the standard local
echo mode is used, so the setting of this parameter has no
effect. However, many timesharing systems (eg. UNIX) prefer to
do their own echoing of typed input. (This makes screen editors
work right, among other things.) Such systems send a Telnet
WILL ECHO offer immediately upon receiving an incoming Telnet
connection request. If \fBecho accept\fP is in effect, a client
Telnet session will automatically return a DO ECHO response. In
this mode, local echoing and editing is turned off and each key
stroke is sent immediately (subject to the Nagle tinygram
algorithm in TCP). While this mode is just fine across an
Ethernet, it is clearly inefficient and painful across slow
paths like packet radio channels. Specifying \fBecho refuse\fP
causes an incoming WILL ECHO offer to be answered with a DONT
ECHO, the client Telnet session remains in the local echo mode.
Sessions already in the remote echo mode are unaffected. (Note:
Berkeley UNIX has a bug in that it will still echo input even
after the client has refused the WILL ECHO offer. To get around
this problem, enter the \fBstty -echo\fP command to the shell once
you have logged in.)
