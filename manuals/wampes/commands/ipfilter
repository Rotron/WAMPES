.H 2 "ipfilter" " [\fIsubcommand\fP]"
Without an argument, display the IP filter table.
If the IP filter table is empty, \fBWAMPES\fP will allow IP packets
to be sent to any destination.
If the IP filter table contains at least one entry,
\fBWAMPES\fP will allow IP packets to be sent only to destinations listed
in the IP filter table, IP packets to other destinations will be
discarded.
.H 3 "ipfilter add" " \fIhostid\fP[/\fIbits\fP]"
This command adds an entry to the IP filter table.
The optional /\fIbits\fP suffix to \fIhostid\fP specifies how
many leading bits in \fIhostid\fP are to be considered significant.
If not specified, 32 bits (i.e., full significance) is
assumed. With this option, a single IP filter table entry may refer to
many hosts all sharing a common bit string prefix in their IP addresses.
For example, ARPA Class A, B and C networks would use suffixes of /8,
/16 and /24 respectively. The command
.DS I
.ft CW
ipfilter add 44/8
.ft P
.DE
causes any IP addresses beginning with "44" in the first 8 bits to be
allowed, the remaining 24 bits are "don't-cares".
.H 3 "ipfilter drop" " \fIhostid\fP[/\fIbits\fP]"
Remove the specified entry from the IP filter table.
