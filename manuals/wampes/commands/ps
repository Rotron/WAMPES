.H 2 "ps"
Display all current processes in the system. The fields are as follows:
.VL 20 2
.LI \fBPID\fP
The process ID (the address of the process control block).
.LI \fBSP\fP
The current value of the process stack pointer.
.LI \fBstksize\fP
The size of the stack allocated to the process, measured in 16 bit words.
.LI \fBmaxstk\fP
The apparent peak stack utilization of this process,
measured in 16 bit words.
This is done in a somewhat heuristic fashion, so the numbers should be treated
as approximate. If this number reaches or exceeds the \fBstksize\fP figure,
the system is almost certain to crash,
and \fBWAMPES\fP should be recompiled
to give the process a larger allocation when it is started.
.LI \fBevent\fP
The event this process is waiting for, if it is not runnable.
.LI \fBfl\fP
The process status flags. There are two:
W (Waiting for event) and S (suspended - not currently used).
The W flag indicates that the process is waiting for an event.
Note that although there may be several runnable processes at any time
(shown in the \fBps\fP listing as those without the W flag)
only one process is actually running at any one instant.
.LI \fBin\fP
Always zero.
.LI \fBout\fP
Always zero.
.LI \fBname\fP
The name of the process.
.LE
