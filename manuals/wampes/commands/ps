.H 2 "ps"
Display all current processes in the system. The fields are as follows:
.P
\fBPID\fP - Process ID (the address of the process control block).
.P
\fBSP\fP - The current value of the process stack pointer.
.P
\fBstksize\fP - The size of the stack allocated to the process.
.P
\fBmaxstk\fP - The apparent peak stack utilization of this process. This is
done in a somewhat heuristic fashion, so the numbers should be treated
as approximate. If this number reaches or exceeds the stksize figure,
the system is almost certain to crash,
and \fBWAMPES\fP should be recompiled
to give the process a larger allocation when it is started.
.P
\fBevent\fP - The event this task is waiting for, if it is not runnable.
.P
\fBfl\fP - Process status flags. There are two:
W (Waiting for event) and S (suspended - not currently used).
The W flag indicates that the process is waiting for an event, the \fBevent\fP
column will be non-zero. Note that although there may be several
runnable processes at any time (shown in the \fBps\fP listing as those
without the W flag and with zero event fields) only one
process is actually running at any one instant.
