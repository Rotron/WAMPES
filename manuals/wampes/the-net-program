.nr Cl 2 \" Max level of header for table of contents
.H 1 "The /tcp/net Program"
The executable file \fB/tcp/net\fP
(further called \fBWAMPES\fP) provides Internet (TCP/IP),
NET/ROM and AX.25
facilities. Because it has an internal multi-tasking system,
\fBWAMPES\fP can act simultaneously as a client, a server and a packet switch
for all three sets of protocols. That is, while a local user accesses remote
services, the system can also provide those same services to remote users
while also switching IP, NET/ROM and AX.25 packets and frames between other
client and server nodes.
.P
The keyboard and display is used by the local operator to control both host
and gateway level functions, for which a number of commands are provided.
.H 2 "Startup"
.DS I
\fB/tcp/net [-g] [-v]\fP [\fIstartup file\fP]
.DE
When \fBWAMPES\fP is executed without arguments,
it attempts to open the file \fB/tcp/net.rc\fP.
If it exists, it is read and executed as though its contents
were typed on the console as commands.
This feature is useful for configuring network addresses,
attaching communication interfaces, and starting the various services.
.P
The following command-line options are accepted:
.VL 20 2
.LI \fB-g\fP
The \fB-g\fP option causes \fBWAMPES\fP to run in \fBdebug\fP mode.
In \fBdebug\fP mode, \fBWAMPES\fP will NOT:
.BL 5 1
.LI
load or save the ARP table, the IP routing table, or the AX.25 routing table
from or to a disc file
.LI
unlink any UNIX domain sockets
.LI
enable the 120 seconds watch dog timer
.LI
change its UNIX scheduling priority
.LI
check the files \fB/tcp/net\fP and \fB/tcp/net.rc\fP for modifications
.LE
.LI \fB-v\fP
The \fB-v\fP option allows the user to view command execution during
the startup of \fBWAMPES\fP.
It echoes the commands read from the startup file before they are executed.
This is a nice help if \fBWAMPES\fP stops (hangs) during initialization.
.LE 1
After all command-line options, the name of an alternate startup file may
be specified. This file is then opened and read instead
of \fB/tcp/net.rc\fP.
.H 2 "Environment variables"
The following environment variables are read by \fBWAMPES\fP:
.VL 20 2
.LI \fBTZ\fP
The TZ variable should be set to the local timezone. Default is TZ=MEZ-1MESZ.
This is used in various time stamps.
.LE
