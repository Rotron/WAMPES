.H 2 "abort"
Abort a file transfer operation in progress.
When receiving a file, \fBabort\fP simply resets the data connection.
The next incoming data packet will generate a TCP RST (reset) in response
which will clear the remote server.
When sending a file, \fBabort\fP sends a premature end-of-file.
Note that in both cases \fBabort\fP will leave a partial copy of the file on
the destination machine, which must be removed manually if it is
unwanted. \fBAbort\fP is valid only when a transfer is in progress.
