.H 2 "dir" " [\fIremote-directory\fP [\fIlocal-file\fP]]"
Write a listing of \fIremote-directory\fP to standard output or optionally to
\fIlocal-file\fP.
The listing includes any system-dependent information that the server chooses
to include.
For example, most UNIX systems produce output from the command
\fBls -l\fP (see also \fBnlist\fP).
If neither \fIremote-directory\fP nor \fIlocal-file\fP is specified,
list the remote working directory to standard output.
