.H 2 "reget" " \fIremote-file\fP [\fIlocal-file\fP]"
\fBreget\fP acts like \fBget\fP, except that if \fIlocal-file\fP exists and is
smaller than \fIremote-file\fP, \fIlocal-file\fP is presumed to be a
partially transferred copy of \fIremote-file\fP and the transfer is
continued from the apparent point of failure. This command is
useful when transferring very large files over networks that tend
to drop connections.
