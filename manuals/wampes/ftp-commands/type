.H 2 "type" " [a|b|i|l \fIbytesize\fP]"
Set the FTP file transfer type to either ASCII (type \fBa\fP), or
BINARY/IMAGE (type \fBb\fP or \fBi\fP).
The default type is ASCII.
In ASCII mode, files are sent as varying length lines of text
separated by cr/lf sequences.
In BINARY/IMAGE mode, files are sent exactly as they appear in the file system.
ASCII mode should be used whenever transferring text
between dissimilar systems (e.g., UNIX and MS-DOS) because of their
different end-of-line and/or end-of-file conventions.
When exchanging text files between machines of the same type,
either mode will work, but BINARY/IMAGE mode is usually faster.
Naturally, when exchanging raw binary files (executables, compressed archives,
etc) BINARY/IMAGE mode must be used.
Type \fBl\fP (logical byte size) is used when exchanging binary files
with remote servers having oddball word sizes (e.g., DECSYSTEM-10s and 20s).
Locally it works exactly like BINARY/IMAGE, except that it notifies the
remote system how large the byte size is. \fIbytesize\fP is typically 8.
