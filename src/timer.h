/* Software timers
 * There is one of these structures for each simulated timer.
 * Whenever the timer is running, it is on a doubly-linked list
 * pointed to by "Timers". The list is sorted in ascending order of
 * expiration, with the next timer to expire at the head. Each timer's
 * count field contains only the additional INCREMENT over all preceeding
 * timers; this allows the hardware timer interrupt to decrement only the
 * first timer on the chain until it hits zero.
 *
 * Stopping a timer or letting it expire causes it to be removed
 * from the list. Starting a timer puts it on the list at the right
 * place. These operations have to be careful about adjusting the count
 * field of the next entry in the list.
