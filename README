wampes-930711.tar.Z  (compressed) and wampes-930711.tar.gz (gzipped) are
tar archives of WAMPES,  which is a NET/NOS port to HP-UX.  It currently
supports HP 9000 series 300, 400, 700, and 800 computers,  running HP-UX
08.xx or HP-UX 09.xx.

I ported  WAMPES to SunOS  4.1.2 and to 386BSD  0.1.34,  and it compiles
there, but I do not have  enough  time to really  test it.  Feedback  is
welcome.

WAMPES was ported to Linux running on a 386 by Olaf Erb, dc1ik.  He also
ported it to ULTRIX  4.2A on a  Decstation  5000 with gcc  2.3.3, but it
wasn't tested properly, too.  Comments and questions about the Linux and
Ultrix      port     of     WAMPES      please     to     Olaf      Erb,
<erb@insu1.etec.uni-karlsruhe.de>.

To unpack this archive you should  create the  directory  /tcp and cd to
it.  After unpacking please read the file /tcp/doc/intro.txt.

wampes-930711.tar.Z,  wampes-930711.tar.gz,  and all followups should go
into /hamradio/packet/tcpip/wampes on UCSD.EDU.

From: Paul Traina <pst@cisco.com>

The A/UX 3.0 port is fully  functional  now.  This is a  straight-across
port with no operational changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now it's here!

This is the  documentation  for the RISC iX  (Acorn  R260  etc)  port of
DK5SG's Wampes.

To install it, unpack the archive in a directory  named /tcp.  Then copy
the files *.R into  /usr/lib  (you must be root of  course).  Then cd to
/tcp/src,  run make  (without  arguments...)  and  ignore  the  compiler
warnings...

To compile convers, cd to /tcp/convers and run make.

I hope, the port is 100 percent correct.  It works here at least :-)

Have fun with it.
