wampes-930415.tar.Z  is a compressed  tar archive of WAMPES,  which is a
NET/NOS  port to HP-UX.  It currently  supports HP 9000 series 300, 400,
700, and 800 computers, running HP-UX 08.xx or HP-UX 09.xx.

I also ported the  software to SunOS 4.1.2 and to 386BSD  0.1.34, and it
compiles  there,  but I do not  have  enough  time to  really  test  it.
Feedback is welcome.

WAMPES was also ported to Linux running on a 386 by Olaf Erb, dc1ik.  He
also ported it to ULTRIX 4.2A on a  Decstation  5000 with gcc 2.3.3, but
it wasn't tested  properly, too.  Comments and questions about the Linux
and     Ultrix     port    of    WAMPES     please    to    Olaf    Erb,
<erb@insu1.etec.uni-karlsruhe.de>.

To unpack this archive you should  create the  directory  /tcp and cd to
it.  After unpacking please read the file /tcp/doc/intro.txt.

wampes-930415.tar.Z     and    all    followups     should    go    into
/hamradio/packet/tcpip/wampes on UCSD.EDU.
